## About 567 COG AF

The 567th Cyberspace Operations Group (COG), Air Force (AF), is responsible for conducting cyberspace operations to protect and defend Air Force networks and systems. The group leverages advanced data science and artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) techniques to enhance mission effectiveness, automate processes, and support decision-making across cyber operations.

This repository contains code and resources developed by the 567 COG ASC Knowledge Management (KM) Team to support AI/ML initiatives within the group.
