CONFIDENTIAL - PACIFIC OPERATIONS INTELLIGENCE SITREP

Classification: SECRET//NOFORN  
Report Period: Q4 2025
Distribution: Pacific Command, Allied Intelligence Partners
Prepared by: Regional Threat Analysis Center

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================

The Pacific theater has experienced a significant escalation in state-sponsored 
cyber activities during Q4 2025. Intelligence indicates coordinated campaigns 
targeting critical infrastructure across Australia, Japan, South Korea, and 
allied military installations throughout the region.

Key developments include the emergence of a sophisticated threat actor designated 
APT-TSUNAMI, attributed with high confidence to a Pacific Rim nation-state. 
This group has demonstrated advanced capabilities including zero-day exploitation, 
custom firmware implants, and quantum-resistant encryption techniques.
