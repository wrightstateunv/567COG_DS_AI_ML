THREAT ACTIVITY SUMMARY - EUROPEAN THEATER

Classification: CONFIDENTIAL//EU EYES ONLY
Report Period: Q4 2025  
Prepared for: European Cybersecurity Agency
Distribution: EU Member State CERTs, NATO Cyber Centre

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
==================

The European cybersecurity landscape in Q4 2025 has been marked by unprecedented 
levels of sophisticated threat activity. State-sponsored actors have intensified 
operations targeting critical energy infrastructure, with particular focus on 
renewable energy grid management systems and cross-border power interconnections.

The period saw 156 confirmed advanced persistent threat incidents across EU 
member states, representing a 41% increase from Q3 2025. Notable trends include 
the weaponization of artificial intelligence for social engineering, supply 
chain compromises affecting multiple countries simultaneously, and the emergence 
of quantum-resistant attack methodologies.
