Deploy updated IOCs and YARA rules for identified malware families 2. Implement additional monitoring for AI-enhanced social engineering 3. Conduct emergency assessments of critical infrastructure protection 4. Activate enhanced information sharing protocols within EU-CERT network Regional Coordination (EU Level - 30-90 days): 1. Establish joint threat hunting operations across member states 2. Create rapid response framework for cross-border incidents
