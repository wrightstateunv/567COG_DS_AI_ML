THREAT ACTIVITY SUMMARY - EUROPEAN THEATER Classification: CONFIDENTIAL//EU EYES ONLY Report Period: Q4 2025 Prepared for: European Cybersecurity Agency Distribution: EU Member State CERTs, NATO Cyber Centre EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW ================== The European cybersecurity landscape in Q4 2025 has been marked by unprecedented levels of sophisticated threat activity. State-sponsored actors have intensified operations targeting critical energy infrastructure, with particular focus on renewable energy grid management systems and cross-border power interconnections. The period saw 156 confirmed advanced persistent threat incidents across EU member states, representing a 41% increase from Q3 2025. Notable trends include the weaponization of artificial intelligence for social engineering, supply chain compromises affecting multiple countries simultaneously, and the emergence of quantum-resistant attack methodologies.
