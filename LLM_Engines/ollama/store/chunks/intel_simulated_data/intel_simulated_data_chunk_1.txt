Introduction and Scope This playbook provides standardized procedures for responding to cybersecurity incidents within our organization. It establishes clear roles, responsibilities, and escalation paths to ensure rapid and effective incident response. 1.1 Incident Definition A cybersecurity incident is defined as any event that compromises or threatens to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information systems or data. 1.2 Scope of Coverage  Malware infections and advanced persistent threats  Unauthorized access attempts and successful breaches  Data theft or exfiltration incidents  Denial of service attacks  Insider threat activities  Third-party vendor security incidents 2. Incident Classification Matrix 2.1 Severity Levels CRITICAL (P1) - Immediate Response Required:  Active data exfiltration in progress  Complete system compromise of critical infrastructure  Ransomware encryption of production systems  Nation-state actor attribution with ongoing activity HIGH (P2) - Response Within 2 Hours:  Confirmed malware on production systems  Successful lateral movement detected  Privilege escalation attempts  Suspicious administrative account activity MEDIUM (P3) - Response Within 8 Hours:  Failed authentication attempts from external sources  Suspicious network traffic patterns  Policy violations by authorized users  Vulnerability exploitation attempts 3. Incident Response Team Structure 3.1 Core Team Members  Incident Commander - Overall response coordination  Security Analyst - Technical investigation and analysis  Systems Administrator - Infrastructure containment and recovery  Communications Lead - Internal and external notifications  Legal Counsel - Regulatory compliance and legal implications  Executive Sponsor - Senior leadership representation 3.2 Contact Information  Emergency Hotline: +1-555-SECURITY (24/7)  Incident Commander: incident-commander@company.com  Security Operations Center: soc@company.com  Executive Escalation: ciso@company.com 4. Phase 1: Detection and Analysis 4.1 Initial Triage Checklist  Verify the incident report and gather initial details  Classify the incident severity using the matrix above  Activate appropriate response team members  Establish incident tracking and documentation  Begin preliminary technical analysis  Preserve evidence and maintain chain of custody 4.2 Evidence Collection Procedures All evidence collection must follow forensically sound practices:  Create bit-for-bit disk images using validated tools  Capture volatile memory contents before system shutdown  Document all actions taken with timestamps  Maintain proper chain of custody documentation  Store evidence in secure, access-controlled environment 5. Phase 2: Containment and Eradication 5.1 Short-term Containment  Isolate affected systems from the network  Disable compromised user accounts  Block malicious IP addresses and domains  Update firewall rules and IPS signatures  Implement temporary access controls 5.2 Long-term Containment and Eradication  Remove malware and malicious artifacts  Patch vulnerabilities that enabled the incident  Rebuild compromised systems from known-good sources  Update security controls and monitoring  Implement additional protective measures 6. Phase 3: Recovery and Post-Incident 6.1 System Recovery Procedures 
